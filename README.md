# Forest Fire
Project made during Mathematical Packages Course at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in cooperation with https://github.com/HalasTomasz

Using Agent-based model we simulate forest fire via transmition to nearest agent(tree). We included in our model natural barries like rivers as well as factors which helps fire to spread.
